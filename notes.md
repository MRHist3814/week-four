READINGS

* I'm reminded of the diary from an earlier class, and how mining for words and phrases tells us something about the writer.

  * We can 'read' the diary, or the trial, differently. Digital technologies allow for the advancement of arguments.

* Makes me wonder about morality, particularly regarding studies of dead people.

  * Digitization allows for easier access and greater efficiency in research. Scroll through albums of photos rather than dig through physical archives.
  
  * What toll does that play on the morality of the situation? Do historians owe something to the dead, and does digitization change that?

* The confabulaion reading reminds me of the incorrect, yet tempting, approaches to research some people take.

  * Having a hypothesis and working the evidence to fit it, rather than following where the evidence itself leads.

EXCEL

* Followed initial instructions. So far ended up with a sum of P15500:P15503 as 20780. Chart worked fine.

RStudio

* Tried to install the RCurl packages and got an error: "Error in library("RCurl") : there is no package called ‘RCurl’"

  * Was running both lines at once. Fixed that easily enough.
  
* Was having trouble setting my directory to where I wanted it to go. After some internet searches, I found a solution.

* Ran the 'counts' and got a table of results. Made the barchart.

  * My assumption for fixing this would be to do what we did last time with the Texan correspondence. Make clusters.

* Everything seems to have worked as intended.

VOYANT

* Been unable to access voyant-tools.org for two days now. Will move on and return here later.

* Using https://service.sadilar.org/voyant/ as a workaround got me through the process.

  * Corpus ID: 49f48aa297f23faaecb77e664a9f0650
  
* Questions:

  * Is there a trend of negative descriptors applied to colonized peoples, and positive for the colonizers?
  
  * Do terms like 'law, order, peace, civility,' occur when discussing unrest or unease in the colonies?
  
  * Are there splits in opinion between parliamentarians in different parties? Do quotes from either use different terms?
  
  * What progression of language is there as time passes from the 18th into the 19th Century?

* Not sure I was asking the right questions above. I didn't feel like I knew where to go from there.
