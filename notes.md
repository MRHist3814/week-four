READINGS

* I'm reminded of the diary from an earlier class, and how mining for words and phrases tells us something about the writer.

  * We can 'read' the diary, or the trial, differently. Digital technologies allow for the advancement of arguments.

* Makes me wonder about morality, particularly regarding studies of dead people.

  * Digitization allows for easier access and greater efficiency in research. Scroll through albums of photos rather than dig through physical archives.
  
  * What toll does that play on the morality of the situation? Do historians owe something to the dead, and does digitization change that?

* The confabulaion reading reminds me of the incorrect, yet tempting, approaches to research some people take.

  * Having a hypothesis and working the evidence to fit it, rather than following where the evidence itself leads.

EXCEL

* Followed initial instructions. So far ended up with a sum of P15500:P15503 as 20780. Chart worked fine.

RStudio

* Tried to install the RCurl packages and got an error: "Error in library("RCurl") : there is no package called ‘RCurl’"

  * Was running both lines at once. Fixed that easily enough.
  
* Was having trouble setting my directory to where I wanted it to go. After some internet searches, I found a solution.

* Ran the 'counts' and got a table of results. Made the barchart.

  * My assumption for fixing this would be to do what we did last time with the Texan correspondence. Make clusters.

* Everything seems to have worked as intended.
